## Assignment

I did my serverless and microservices skills and put them into action in a project that combines these technologies into a single web application. I did create a serverless web application -- a simple guestbook website where users can post messages -- and I did host the website in two different ways.

Below is the architecture for one version which uses object storage to host the site's files.
